# Evaluation of dapp-plaforms

Focusing on Systemic Flaws that render the platform non-usable

## Platforms

| Platform |  Result | Main Reasons, Link |
| - | - | - |
| Algorand | Fail | [Flawed Foundation/Inc./Projects/Processes](https://github.com/systemic-flaws/dapp-platforms/issues/8 ) |
| Solana   | Fail | [Flawed Project/Processes/Information](https://github.com/systemic-flaws/dapp-platforms/issues/9) |
| Avalanche | Fail | [Flawed Project/Processes/Information](https://github.com/systemic-flaws/dapp-platforms/issues/10) |

## Evaluation Context

You want to issue a token to handle monetary value. Real monetary value will be bound to this token.

At some point, the platform on which the token was issued has problems with development.

You enter the project in order to assist solving those problems.

But open source is not enough.

### Minimum Requirements

* Open Sources
* Open Projects
* Open Processes

This would mean things like:

* No individual or groups of individuals should have the power to block valid contributions.
* No internal repositories, issue-trackers, test-servers etc.

If you think that this is something obvious, something that all crypto/dapp-platforms have, then be ready for a surprise.

Just take a look at the evaluations.
