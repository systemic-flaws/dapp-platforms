# Evaluation of dapp-plaforms

Focusing on Systemic Flaws that render the platform non-usable

## Platforms

Platforms like Algorand, Avalanche and Solana fail.

Framework-Platforms like Substrate fail.

- [Fail: **Algorand** (Flawed Projects/Processes/Foundation/Inc.)](https://github.com/systemic-flaws/dapp-platforms/issues/8)
- [Fail: **Solana** (Flawed Project/Processes/Information)](https://github.com/systemic-flaws/dapp-platforms/issues/9)
- [Fail: **Avalanche** (Flawed Project/Processes/Information)](https://github.com/systemic-flaws/dapp-platforms/issues/10)
- [Fail: **Substrate** Framework (Flawed Project/Processes/Information)](https://github.com/systemic-flaws/dapp-platforms/issues/13)

## Evaluation Context

Issuing a Token

You want to issue a token to handle monetary value. Real monetary value will be bound to this token.

At some point, the platform on which the token was issued has problems with development.

You enter the project in order to assist solving those problems.

But open source is not enough.

### Minimum Requirements

* Open Sources
* Open Projects
* Open Processes

This would mean things like:

* No individual or groups of individuals should have the power to block valid contributions.
* No internal repositories, issue-trackers, test-servers etc.
* No exhausting/blocking slow-speed processes (amateur or even incompetent human factor)

If you think that this is something obvious, something that all crypto/dapp-platforms have, then be ready for a surprise.

Just take a look at the evaluations.
