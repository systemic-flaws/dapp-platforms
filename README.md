Evaluation of dapp-plaforms

Focusing on Systemic Flaws that render the platform non-usable

## Evaluation Context

Imagine that you issue a token to handle monetary value. Real monetary value is bound to this token.

At some point, the platform on which the token was issued has problems with development.

You enter the project in order to assist solving those problems.

You think "should be easy, it is open source".

But open source is not enough.

It needs to be an "Open Project", with "Open Processes".

* No individual or groups of individuals should have the power to block valid contributions.
* No internal repositories, issue-trackers, test-servers etc.

If you think that this is something obvious, something that all platforms have, then be ready for a surprise.

Just take a look at the evaluations.
